## Repository Overview

## Development Commands

Tools in scripts directory. When building the application, use the `build` script.

```bash
claude             # Run claude with extra options
build              # Build app
run                # Run app
br                 # Build and run app
debug              # Debug app
setup              # Configure tools and git hooks
worktree           # Setup git worktrees and branches
```

Claude: after making changes, build the application if you'd didn't build it already, and run the simulator.
